The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if the calculation is too complex. For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` works fine, but `calc(100% - 50%)` is problematic as it subtracts a percentage from a percentage, resulting in an unexpected value. Another example is using `calc(100vw - 100%)`, which can cause issues depending on the viewport size and how the percentage is calculated relative to its parent container. Also, nested `calc()` functions can become difficult to debug and may lead to unexpected behavior.  Furthermore, browser support for very complex `calc()` expressions can vary.
